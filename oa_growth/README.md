# oa_growth

Analysis of growth in open access articles using PubMed and PMC data. Partly in response to [this blog post](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1654).

Confession: I initially failed to realise that "true OA" = the OA subset of PubMed Central.

Reports are at RPubs:

* [Growth in free and closed scientific publications 2000-2013](http://rpubs.com/neilfws/45825)
* [Growth in the OA subset of PubMed Central 2000-2013](http://rpubs.com/neilfws/45828)
