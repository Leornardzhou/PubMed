h1. PubMed Retraction Data

There are 3 directories in this section of the repository:

* data
* code/ruby and code/R
* output

h2. Data

PubMed XML files for the queries "Retraction of Publication"[Publication Type] and "Retracted Publication"[Publication Type].

h2. Code

Ruby and R code for processing the data.  The key scripts and their output files are:

* retraction_count.rb -> retractions.tsv
- prints year, publications count, retractions count and retraction notices count for 1971-2011
* pubmedxml2mongo.rb (no output file)
- parses PubMed XML files and saves records in a mongodb database
* mongo2journal.rb -> retractions_journals.tsv
- prints pmid, journal, publication date, Medline date created and country published for retracted records
* mongo2mesh.rb -> retractions_mesh.tsv
- prints pmid, year and mesh terms for retracted records
* mongo2dates.rb -> retractions_dates.tsv
- prints pmids and years for publication + its retraction

In addition, there are currently (2011-07-05) two R scripts:

* by_journal.R -> retractions_journals_count.tsv
- counts retractions by journal
* by_country.R -> retractions_country_count.tsv
- counts retractions by country of publication (NOT of authors)

h2. Output

Holds the output files from scripts in code directory. Usually TSV (tab-separated values) format.
