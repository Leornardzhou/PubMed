h1. Sinatra Code

This directory contains the code which runs the "pmretract":http://pmretract.heroku.com/ application, hosted by Heroku/MongoHQ.

Right now, it's not recommended that you try to run the sinatra code locally.  However, if you want to try, the steps are as follows:

# Download the code, _e.g. git clone git@github.com:neilfws/PubMed.git_ and _cd code/sinatra_
# _bundle install_
# Install "MongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org on the same machine (default host _localhost_ and port)
# Change back to the _code/ruby_ directory
# Run scripts in order: _ecnt2mongo.rb, xml2mongo.rb, timeline.rb_ (requires the BioRuby _bio_ gem)
# Change back to _code/sinatra_ and start the application (_e.g. shotgun config.ru_)

In the future, Rakefile will supply tasks to replace step 5.
